PROLOGUE


You know, being married is one thing. Being married to someone from another tribe is another thing, but being married to someone from a different country—especially a place like Israel—is a whole other thing. But I’m a whole other thing (at least that’s what my parents call me).


Mahlon, my loving husband, always made sure I never missed home—not that I would ever miss it. My parents have never cared about my welfare or me, but my husband did. Even his family is better than mine; his mom loves me like her own child, and his father looks at me with respect.


You don’t know me, I’m sure; no one does. But I’ll still tell my story, after this maybe you will.


My name is Orpah, and this is my story.













Chapter 1

“Orpie, Orpie!” the nickname my best friend calls me rung in my ears as the beautiful morning light of Zariel, the god who brings the sun and watches over the day, slowly filters through my window.

 Ohhh, how I can’t wait to leave this house.

“Orpie, Orpie!” My best friend Ruth said again  pulling me back to reality.

“Oh, hi Ruth. I got lost in my thoughts,” I said, coming back to reality.

“But today is our day. Try not to ruin it,” Ruth said in a playful tone.

Her words hit me in the wrong place. “What do you mean by that?” I snapped.

Ruth’s eyes widened, and she quickly apologized. “Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean anything by it.”

Noticing my sadness over how I had snapped at her, Ruth’s caring nature shone through. “Don’t be down; it was my fault for being insensitive.”

Realizing how I’d sounded, I softened my tone. “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap. I guess I’m just a bit on edge.”

“No worries,” Ruth said with a reassuring smile. “Let’s focus on making today great.”

I almost ruined our perfect day—a double marriage between me and Mahlon and Ruth and Chilion—just like she said, maybe she was right.

“Don’t be down; Let’s make today enjoyable,for both of us.”  Ruth said, her smile radiated light almost as bright as Sun. Her husband was really lucky to have her.

“Sure, you lead the way” I said, as we both smiled at each other and got ready. Our husbands were downstairs waiting for us.




























Chapter 2
We both went downstairs to meet our future husbands. Oh, and by the way, we were at my parents' house—devout worshippers of Chemosh. They didn’t exactly welcome these upstart Judeans with open arms, but that wouldn’t spoil our day.

“Orpah, your Nasi is here,” my mother said with much disdain. I could never understand why she disliked the Judeans so much—they were kind, compassionate, and handsome, unlike the family I call my own.

“Orpie, come back,” Ruth whispered in my ear when she noticed that I got distracted and entered my world of thoughts again.


“Orpah, you didn’t even greet me,” Mahlon said in a playful tone. Ohh, how much his voice gives me butterflies.


“Hi... hii,” I said, blushing. The many years I’ve known my husband-to-be (just 2), and I still can’t get over how handsome he is. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my older brother, Hadar, rolling his eyes.

“Talk properly, you’re not a stammerer, are you?” he yelled, loud enough for everyone to hear.

I saw my father chuckling, proud of his first-born son—the apple of his eye—unlike the daughter he had, who was about to be married to a flimsy Jew.

But Mahlon, the father of my children, stood up and defended me, as did Ruth and her husband. Together, they navigated the tensions and led me to the marriage grounds—a beautiful spot just north of the hillside of Dibon, where the ceremony would take place.
































Chapter 3


“Mahlon, you’ve chosen a beautiful, fine young woman. I’m proud of you,” Mahlon’s father, Elimelech, said, his voice full of warmth and approval.

Mahlon beamed with pride as he responded, “Thank you, Father. I’m honored to have Orpah by my side.”

Elimelech’s wife, Naomi, smiled warmly at me. “Orpah, you look radiant. We’re so happy to welcome you into our family.”

“Thank you, Chamot,” I replied, my cheeks flushing with gratitude. “I’m honored to be part of your family.”

Naomi nodded, her eyes reflecting a mix of approval and emotion. “Call me Naomi. I don’t mind.”

“Thank you Cha… I mean, thank you Naomi. I’m really grateful,” I said, full of smiles and internally grateful for the type of mother-in-law I have.

Ruth, standing nearby with Chilion by her side, grinned and joined the conversation. “Orpah, you look absolutely stunning.”

“Oh, Ruth,” I said, laughing lightly, “you made the dress.”

“I Know” She said smiling cheekily and everyone laughed.

Suddenly, the Levite in charge stepped forward. “Sorry to interrupt, but it’s time for the signing of the Ketubah.”

The announcement brought a flurry of activity as everyone began to prepare for the next part of the ceremony, I felt a pang of sadness. My parents were supposed to be here to collect the cloth of virginity after we entered the tent, but they didn’t want to have anything to do with me.

“Orpie, come back from your world,” Mahlon called me gently.

I turned to him, feeling a mix of emotions. “You get distracted a lot. What are you thinking about? Another man, I hope not,” Mahlon joked, trying to lighten the mood.

I couldn’t help but smile, though my heart ached. “Just that my parents are not here, and it kinda hurts.”

Mahlon took my hand, his expression softening. “Don’t worry, I’ll be better to you than your parents ever were.”

“I know,” I replied, and I meant it. I really did.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Ruth smiling at me as she and her husband also signed the Ketubah. I felt grateful to be able to see that person everyday of my life, apart from My husband, Ruth was my next favourite person.

“Now that the Ketubah has been signed, it is now time for both the couples to enter the tent and perform their conjugal duties” the priest said from the top of the elevated platform that he was standing on.

“Come my ishah, let’s make it formal” Mahlon said as he accompanied me in to the tent.





Chapter 4


                          *2 years later*
                       

“Woe is me, woe is me, what did I do to deserve this? Ehimelech, why did you leave me?” Naomi cried out, her voice breaking with grief as tears streamed down her cheeks.

“Mother, please,” Chilion said, his own tears barely held back. “If you are crying this much, what do you want us to do?”

“Let me cry, let me scream. I’m hurt,” Naomi sobbed, her anguish evident.

“Ima, please stop,” Chilion pleaded, trying to console her.

“I can’t, please stop trying to stop me,” Naomi insisted, her grief overpowering her.

“For your health, Ma, we can’t lose you too,” Mahlon said, desperate to ease her suffering.

“I want to go,” Naomi mourned, her voice filled with a deep, hollow sorrow. “I want to go to Sheol. I want to be with my husband.”

The weight of her words hung heavily in the air. I felt it too, the same way I lost my daughter just few months back. Naomi's sorrow was intertwined with a profound sense of injustice. “Why, why was this calamity happening to us? Why now, just as I was about to convert to Judaism? What kind of God allows such suffering? —what does that say about his power?”

Naomi’s despair seemed boundless, her faith in her own God shaken by the tragedy. Why couldn’t his God save him from the arrow of fate? If he were truly powerful, he would have protected him. Our gods are stronger, I mean how else would you explain just falling down and dying. I don’t understand why this is happening. Maybe because he was worshiping another god in our land, if that’s the case I can’t worship a weak god.

“Orpie,” Ruth whispered, her voice trembling with fear, bringing me out of my own inner turmoil “what if this is the gods' way of punishing us?”

Her words echoed my own doubts, fears I hadn’t yet voiced.

“Don’t say that, Ruth,” I replied, forcing a reassuring smile. “I’m sure there’s another explanation. The gods… they can’t care so much about a measly Judean family.”

“But what if they do?” Ruth persisted, her eyes wide with worry. “What if they’re angry with us for… for everything?”

“Ruth, stop,” I said more firmly, though my heart pounded with the same questions. “We can’t think like that. We have to believe that there’s a reasonable explanation, that it’s not just… punishment.”

Ruth nodded, though the fear in her eyes remained. I reached out and took her hand, squeezing it tightly. “We’ll get through this, Ruth. Together. We have to stay strong, for Naomi, for everyone.”

“I hope you’re right, Orpie,” she whispered, her grip on my hand tightening. “I hope you’re right.”

But now, I was more afraid. What if it was exactly that—punishment?





Chapter 5
Since the death of Ehimelech and the loss of my daughter—more about that later—things have changed. Ruth no longer follows me to the altar of Chemosh, the patron god of Moab. She stays behind with Naomi, immersing herself in the worship of her god. I still can’t bring myself to love a god like that, one who seems so distant and detached. Naomi defends her god, Yahweh, saying it was punishment for leaving their homeland and coming here without His permission. But that doesn’t make sense to me. They told me they left because of the famine of their land, so their god would kill them because they were trying to survive, I don’t like that type of god.

One evening, as I prepared for another sacrifice to Chemosh, I found Ruth sitting quietly, her gaze distant. I approached her, hoping to understand her sudden shift in devotion.

“Ruth, why do you stay behind? Our customs, our traditions—they mean something,” I said, trying to mask my frustration.

Ruth looked up, her eyes reflecting a mix of sadness and determination. “Orpah, I’ve been thinking. Naomi’s God, Yahweh, may be different from Chemosh, but she speaks of Him with such conviction. I can’t ignore that.”

“Different?” I retorted, anger clearly evident in my tone. “He’s weak, Ruth. He couldn’t save her husband, he couldn’t save my daughter, how can you follow a god like that?”

Ruth shook her head slowly. “It’s not just about what happened. It’s about faith. Naomi has endured so much, yet she still believes. Maybe there’s something to that belief, something I need to understand.”

“so I haven’t endured much?” I shouted at her but deep down, I knew that question was really directed at that god.

“That’s not what I mean, I’m sorry” she said, tears welling in her eyes

“ I know, I’m sorry too” I said trying to comfort her.

“But”  I frowned, feeling a pang of concern. “But what if you’re just being misled? Naomi’s grief might be clouding her judgment. How can you turn away from Chemosh, who has always been good to us?”

“As he really?” Ruth’s voice was soft but firm. “I’m not turning away from Chemosh out of disrespect. I’m searching for truth. If Yahweh offers something more, something better, then I need to find him.”

I was taken aback by her resolve. “You truly believe that? After everything?”

Ruth nodded. “Yes, Orpah. I need to discover if there’s a higher purpose behind our suffering. If Naomi’s god is weak, then I’ll find that out. But if there’s something more, I need to see it for myself.”

I sighed, feeling a mixture of frustration and sadness. “Just promise me one thing. Promise me you’ll be careful. I don’t want to lose you to this… new belief.”

Ruth smiled faintly, her gaze softening. “I promise, Orpah. I’ll be cautious. And perhaps, someday, you’ll understand what I see.”

I left, went back to preparing the sacrifice but as I did, her words came back.

‘See what I see’, what exactly did she see, I don’t think I want to see it. The pain is too much, the pain of losing a father, the pain of losing a child. Ruth does not understand it, how can she, she has never lost a child, not like she has had any-but her pain can never compare to mine, never.

“Orpah, Orpah, you’re lost in thought again,” my husband’s voice broke through my reverie. “You sure we shouldn’t check it out?” He said obviously trying to make me feel better.

I forced a smile, grateful for his attempt to lighten the mood. “I’m fine, just lost in thought.”

He leaned closer, his voice gentle. “What’s on your mind? You know you can talk to me.”

I hesitated before asking, “This god of yours—Yahweh—can He truly be as you say?”

His expression grew serious. “He is… and beyond.”

“Then why?” I whispered, my voice trembling. “Why did He take your father? Why did He take my child?”

His face clouded with pain, tears welling in his eyes. “We disobeyed Him, and we suffer for it. But He shows mercy. We’re not destitute; we’re managing.”

I shook my head, frustration boiling over. “None of you understand me! I’m so tired of hearing about this ‘mercy.’ What mercy is there in suffering? Does it bring back my daughter?”

He reached out, his voice filled with concern. “Orpah, please… don’t let this grief turn into anger against Yahweh. We can’t always understand His ways, but we can trust that there’s a reason.”

“A reason?” I scoffed, bitterness rising. “What reason could justify taking away everything we love?”

He stood, his eyes filled with sorrow. “I don’t have all the answers, Orpah. But turning away from Yahweh won’t bring peace. Please, try to have faith.”

I wanted to believe him, but doubt was too strong, the wound too deep. I pulled away, turning to leave. “I need time,” I whispered.

“Take all the time you need,” he said gently. “I’ll be here, waiting.”

As I walked away, the pain resurfaced, I saw it again, the blood. What god leaves their worshipper childless, I was not a worshipper but my husband was, a devout one at that. A merciful god he is. The pain I’ve felt no one has felt it, no-one.


Chapter 6

“Mama, Mama!” I jolted awake, my body drenched in sweat, heart pounding fiercely. The echoes of the dream clung to the dim light of dawn, the pain as vivid as it had been on the day it happened.

I sat up, clutching the blanket tightly, trying to shake off the haunting images. The sound of a baby crying, the warmth of tiny hands that I would never feel again, the gaping void that would never be filled. My heart ached with a sorrow that had only deepened with time.

"Orpah?" My husband’s groggy voice broke through the fog of my grief. “Another dream?”

I nodded, unable to find the words. The tears I had held back now flowed freely, and I wiped them away with frustration. “It was her again. She was calling for me… Why does this keep happening? Why do I keep seeing her?”

He reached out, pulling me into his arms. “Because you loved her. Because you’re her mother.”

“But she’s gone!” I cried out, my voice breaking as grief resurfaced. “She’s gone, and nothing I do will bring her back. It’s cruel, and I hate it. I hate that I keep dreaming of her, that I keep feeling this pain. Why can’t it just stop?”

He held me tighter, his own eyes glistening with unshed tears. “I wish I had answers, Orpah. I wish I could take this pain away.”

“It’s Yahweh’s fault,” I spat bitterly. “If He’s so powerful, why didn’t He save her? Why didn’t He save me? What kind of god does that? What kind of god lets a child die at birth?”

My husband was silent, the tension between his faith and his desire to comfort me palpable. “Orpah,” he began carefully, “we don’t always understand His ways. But maybe… maybe there’s a reason for all of this.”

“A reason?” I pulled away, anger blazing in my eyes. “What reason could there possibly be for losing our child? What purpose does it serve?”

He sighed, reaching for me again, but I moved out of his reach. “I don’t know, Orpah. But I have to believe there’s more to this than we can see.”

“Well, I don’t believe it,” I snapped. “I can’t believe in a god that allows such suffering. Chemosh may not be perfect, but at least he doesn’t pretend to be merciful while letting innocent lives slip away.”

He looked at me, a mix of sorrow and helplessness in his gaze. “Orpah, I know you’re hurting. I’m hurting too. But we can’t let this tear us apart.”

“It already has,” I whispered, the weight of the words sinking in. “It already has.”

He didn’t respond, and I felt a pang of guilt for the hurt I might have caused him. But I was hurting too. Was I being selfish? Shouldn't he share in this pain with me? He should, he definitely should. 



The dawn was breaking by the time I finally rose from the bed, the weight of the night’s emotions still pressing heavily on my chest. My husband had fallen back to sleep, his steady breathing  contrast to the storm raging inside me. I needed air, I needed clarity, and maybe… I needed someone to talk to.

I found Naomi in the small courtyard, her hands busy with the morning chores. She looked up as I approached, her face softening into a gentle smile. “Good morning, Orpah. You’re up early.”

I forced a smile, but it felt brittle on my lips. “I couldn’t sleep. The dreams… they’re getting worse.”

Naomi’s eyes filled with concern as she set down the basket she was holding and came to stand beside me. “I’m so sorry, my dear. I wish there was something I could do to ease your pain.”

“I don’t think anything can,” I replied, my voice hollow. “The pain is always there, Naomi. It never goes away. And every time I think I’m getting stronger, the dreams just… they pull me right back into it.”

Naomi reached out, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. “Grief is a cruel companion. It stays with us longer than we’d like, doesn’t it?”

I nodded, feeling the sting of tears again. “I just don’t understand. Why does Yahweh allow this? Why did He take my child? Why does He let us suffer like this?”

Naomi’s expression grew thoughtful, and she led me to a nearby bench where we both sat. “Orpah,  I know it’s hard. I’ve experienced my own share of grief. I’ve felt that same anger, that same confusion.”

“And what did you find?” I asked, a trace of bitterness creeping into my voice. “Did you find answers? Did He speak to you?”

Naomi sighed, her gaze distant. “No, Orpah, He didn’t speak to me in the way you might expect. But in the silence, I found something else—hope. A small, fragile hope that there was a purpose, even in the pain. You may not hear Him, but you’ll feel Him.”

“A purpose?” I echoed, shaking my head. “What purpose could there be in losing a child? What purpose is there in this endless suffering?”

Naomi looked at me with a deep, knowing sadness. “I can’t say what His purpose is for you, Orpah. But I do believe that He doesn’t waste our pain. Somehow, in some way, He uses it to shape us, to teach us, to draw us closer to Him.”

“I don’t want to be closer to Him,” I admitted, my voice trembling. “I want to be free of this pain. I want my daughter back.”

Naomi’s hand tightened on mine, and she looked at me with a fierce compassion. “I know, my dear. And it’s okay to feel that way. It’s okay to be angry, to question, to grieve. Yahweh is big enough to handle our anger, our doubts. He’s not offended by our pain; He’s moved by it.”

“But what if I can’t forgive Him?” I asked, the tears flowing freely now. “What if I can’t move past this? Does that make me a bad person? A bad wife?”

Naomi shook her head gently. “No, Orpah. It makes you human. And it’s in our humanity that Yahweh meets us with His grace. He doesn’t ask for blind faith or unquestioning loyalty. He invites us to wrestle with Him, to bring our pain to Him. He understands, even when we don’t. Have I ever told you of our ancestor, Abraham”

“No, I don’t think you have”

“Sit” she said motioning me to a stool besides her”


“Well, this man, responsible for all of Israel was called by God to leave his homeland to a place where he would take him…”

“But” I said interrupting her sermon “You also left your homeland”

“Patience, This man left not knowing where he was going only held by the promise of God to bless him and enlarge his coast. That his descendants will be as many as the stars in the sky and the sand on the shore of the beach, mind you, he had no child at the time” She said stopping momentarily allowing me to fully grasp what she said.

“But, he always believed and when God blessed him, he did so with one child and that was the child of the promise, guess what God did with him”

“He killed him” I said using my own experience to sarcastically answer.

“Something like that actually”

“i knew it, your god is nothing but a wicked one” I said anger starting to boil within me.

Naomi looked at me with genuine love for me but I could see pain as I was not getting her message.

“How do you think I am here right now. What really happened was that he told Abraham to sacrifice him to test his faith, to see if he loved his son more than his God. He loved his God more.”

“So how did his son survive” I asked with genuine wonder cause there was no way anyone could hide from a god especially someone that was alleged the maker of the universe.

“God saved him, when God saw that Abraham loved him more than his beloved son, he saved him” As she said this, she touched my hands and squeezed them. “God loves you, he really does, all he wants is your love back.”

I looked down at my hands, feeling the warmth of Naomi’s touch and the weight of her words. “I don’t know if I can do that, Naomi. I don’t know if I can ever love Him.”

Naomi’s eyes softened with empathy. “You don’t have to decide that now, Orpah. Just take it one day at a time. Lean on those who love you, and don’t be afraid to lean on Yahweh too, even if you’re angry with Him. He’s patient. He’ll wait for you.”

I nodded, though the doubts still lingered in my heart. “Thank you, Naomi. I don’t know if I’ll ever believe like you do, but… thank you for understanding.”

Naomi smiled gently, pulling me into a warm embrace. “You don’t have to believe like I do, Orpah. Just know that you’re not alone in this. I’m here for you, always.”

As she held me, I felt a small, fragile sense of peace—a flicker of comfort in the midst of my turmoil. The pain was still there, but for a moment, it felt a little less unbearable.





Chapter 7


"Orpie, please come," Mahlon said, his voice soft, his eyes filled with a longing that tugged at my heart despite the anger that still remained within me. I hesitated, crossing my arms as I stood just out of reach. "I noticed the tension between us, and I don't like it. I want to fix it."

"What are you proposing?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but it came out more sheepish than I intended, I guess I also missed him.

"Let’s go back to where it all began—where I proposed and where we met," he replied, a spark of excitement lighting up his face. "The lake near the central well of the city."

I couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at my lips. "Oh, I remember..."



                                       *4 years ago*



"My mother is so annoying, always telling me I must marry soon. What if I don't want to marry?" I burst out, frustration spilling over as I paced the narrow street, my hands gesturing wildly.

"Calm down, Orpie. I’m sure you want to marry," Ruth said, her voice gentle as she tried to soothe me, though the amusement in her eyes didn’t go unnoticed.

"Not like this! Not because she says I should. I’ll marry when I find someone worth marrying, not before."

Ruth chuckled softly. "And what if you soon will, look behind you?"

I rolled my eyes, but I decided to just listen and I turned and saw him—a figure standing near the well, watching me with a half-smile. "Ruth, look at that handsome man over there. He’s looking at me!"

Ruth smiled and started laughing. "Oh yeah, those are the new Judeans who arrived in the city," she whispered. "Go talk to him."

"What? Me? No, no, I can’t just—"

"Orpah, you were just complaining about your mother’s pressure to marry. Here’s your chance to meet someone on your own terms. Go on."

“but he is not even a Moabite, you know how my mother gets, how is this better”

“Is he fine”

“I guess”

“Then go talk to him” My best-friend then pushed me to where they were standing.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves, and took a step toward the man who seemed to be waiting for me to make the first move. Our eyes met, and in that moment, something shifted—a connection, a spark I couldn’t quite explain.


                    *Back to the present*


Mahlon and I sat by the lake, the cool breeze playing with the strands of my hair. The water sparkled under the sun, just as it had the day we first met. We didn’t need words to fill the silence; the memories between us were enough.

"You know," Mahlon began, his voice cutting through my thoughts, "I’ve always loved this place. It’s where everything changed for me."

I looked at him, seeing the sincerity in his eyes. "For me too," I admitted, my heart softening. "I guess... I guess I forgot that in all the chaos."

He reached out, taking my hand in his. "Let’s not forget again."

As we sat there, reminiscing, I felt the tension between us ease, but just a bit, I was still angry with him but not much anymore. I loved him better, We weren’t perfect, but maybe perfection wasn’t what we needed. Maybe we just needed each other.


Chapter 8
There is nothing worse than losing a loved one. Losing two loved ones is mind-wrenching; losing three, you just lose your mind. That’s how I felt when Mahlon fell sick. We visited doctor after doctor, each one saying the same thing: “Let him rest.” But rest was doing nothing—he was only getting worse.

Mahlon lay on the bed, his face pale, his breath shallow. I paced the room, my hands wringing together in helplessness. Every healer in the city had come and gone, offering the same hollow advice. Rest, herbs, prayers—nothing was working. I could feel the panic rising in my chest like a beast clawing its way out.

Why is this happening? I thought bitterly. Why is he suffering like this?

I left the room, needing air, needing to escape the stifling atmosphere of sickness and despair. That’s when I saw her—Naomi, kneeling in the courtyard, her hands clasped together, her lips moving silently in prayer. To Yahweh, of course. Always Yahweh.

Rage boiled up inside me, hot and fast, threatening to spill over. How could she pray to that god? The god who had taken so much already. The god who had done nothing to stop this, trying to take another one from me.

“Naomi,” I called, my voice trembling with barely restrained anger.

She looked up, her eyes red from weeping, her expression one of desperate hope.

“Orpah,” she said softly, her voice cracking. “I’m praying for Mahlon. I’m asking Yahweh to heal him.”

I stared at her, my fists clenching at my sides. “And you think that will help?” I spat, unable to hold back any longer. “You think your god cares? You think he’s listening? He’s done nothing but take from us!”

Naomi’s eyes widened in shock, but she didn’t speak. She just watched me, her face crumpling as my words hit her.

“I’m losing him, Naomi,” I continued, my voice breaking. “I’m losing my husband, and I don’t know what to do. And you—you just pray to the god who’s taken everything from me. What kind of god is that? Why would I trust him?”

Tears spilled down my cheeks, my chest heaving with sobs. “I’m so scared, I’m sorry I barked at you,” I whispered, my anger giving way to raw, aching sorrow. “I just don’t want to lose him. I’m so angry with him, but I don’t want him to die.”

Naomi stood, crossing the courtyard to take me in her arms. I resisted for a moment, but then I let her hold me, letting her comfort me in a way only a mother could.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I’m so sorry, Orpah.”

I clung to her, my heart breaking, feeling more lost than ever. I didn’t know what to believe anymore, but for the first time, I felt the weight of my anger begin to lift, just a little.

“I don’t want to lose him too,” Naomi confessed. “I’ve already lost a husband, a friend... why would I want to lose a son?”

“But instead of helping him, you are praying to this... this god,” I retorted.

“You are so angry with Yahweh, but have you tried to see things His way, to see His plan?” Naomi said softly.

“What plan could He possibly have for me?” I shot back.

“A good plan. He loves you, Orpah, He really does.”

“Well, if this is the definition of His love, I don’t want it,” I said.
I turned away, storming out of the courtyard, trying to escape the suffocating weight of my emotions. As I approached the threshold to clear my mind, I almost bumped into Ruth.

“Orpie, I’m sorry,” she said softly, her voice trembling.

“Why are you sorry? You didn’t do anything,” I replied, but the pain in my voice was unmistakable.

“I just feel like I haven’t been there for you lately, despite all you’re going through,” Ruth said, her tears reflecting my own.

“No, I’m the one that has been pushing you away. I’m sorry,” I said, guilt settling in my chest.

Ruth hesitated, then spoke again. “Orpie, maybe... maybe trusting Yahweh isn’t such a bad thing. Maybe He’s trying to help, to show you—”

“Don’t,” I snapped, cutting her off. The memory of my confrontation with Naomi surged back, fueling the anger that I had tried to suppress. “Don’t talk to me about Yahweh right now. I’ve had enough of His ‘help.’”

Ruth’s face crumpled, hurt flashing in her eyes. “I’m just trying to—”

“I don’t need your pity or your prayers, Ruth!” I barked, the words sharper than I intended. “Just... leave me alone.”

Ruth flinched, tears streaming down her face as she turned and ran back inside the house. I watched her go, feeling the sting of regret almost immediately, but I was too exhausted, too drained, to call her back.


I walked outside to a tree I often sat under, a place of solace just outside my room. I leaned against the rough bark, staring up at the sky, trying to make sense of the chaos in my heart.

“Why?” I whispered, addressing the heavens. “Why is this happening? What do you want from me? Haven’t I suffered enough?”

“God I want to talk to you, who are you and what do you want from me, why do you enjoy taking away those I love”

A soft whisper, almost impossible to hear said within me “I don’t do that, I don’t take away love, infact I give it”

“Well, why don’t you give me, why do you hate me like this”

The silence that followed was deafening, but deep within, I heard a whisper—soft, yet undeniable. I love you, Orpah, you know I do.

A shiver ran down my spine, and for the first time in days, I felt a sliver of peace. I didn’t fully understand it, but I couldn’t deny it either. I wiped the tears from my face, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over me.



I stood up and made my way back inside. As I entered the room, I saw Mahlon sitting up, eating with a bit more strength than before. My breath caught in my throat. He was still pale, still weak, but there was a noticeable improvement.

I watched him for a moment, feeling a warmth spread through my chest. Maybe, I thought, maybe you’re not so bad after all, Yahweh.

I lingered in the doorway, watching Mahlon. His movements were slow, his strength not yet returned, but the sight of him sitting up, the color returning to his cheeks, filled me with a hope I hadn’t felt in days.

Maybe this was the beginning of something new. Maybe, just maybe, I could start to believe.


Chapter 9

I’d never felt this amount of peace and internal love before. The only other time I felt like this was on my wedding day almost four years ago. 

As I was lost in thought, Mahlon approached and asked, "What’s on your mind, Orpie?"

I took a deep breath, my voice soft and reflective. "You know, this Yahweh isn’t all that bad. I’ve mended all my relationships, apologized to both Ruth and Naomi, and I believe they’ve forgiven me. What I want to do now is to learn more about this God—His love, His kindness, His grace."

Mahlon’s eyes widened slightly, a mix of surprise and admiration in them. He remained silent, giving me space to gather my thoughts.

"I feel different now," I continued, a gentle smile touching my lips. "There’s a peace in my heart that I haven’t felt in so long. I think I’m ready to embrace this faith fully. It’s not just about doing the right thing anymore; it’s about understanding why it’s the right thing."

Mahlon reached for my hands, his touch warm and comforting. His gaze was filled with a tenderness that made my heart swell. "I’m so proud of you, Orpie," he said, his voice choked with emotion. "You’ve always had such strength, even when you didn’t see it. To see you open your heart like this... it makes me love you even more."

His words brought tears to my eyes. "Thank you, Mahlon," I whispered, my voice quivering. "You’ve been so patient with me, never pushing, just waiting. I don’t know if I could have done this without your support."

"You definitely couldn’t," he said playfully.

"Don’t get ahead of yourself, guy," I replied with a laugh.

"I’m your husband. Why wouldn’t I feel proud? I’m just like you remember."

"What does that mean?"

"It means that you are strong and bold, beautiful, and the best woman I could have ever asked for."

I sincerely did not expect that, and I found myself blushing.
Seeing me blushing, my husband took the opportunity to gently tease me, his eyes twinkling with amusement.

"So, you’re blushing now, huh?" he said with a playful grin. "I must be doing something right."

I playfully swatted his arm, my cheeks still warm. "Oh, stop it! You’re making me all shy."

He laughed, wrapping his arms around me in a loving embrace. "I just want you to know how much you mean to me, Orpie. You’re amazing, and I’m so grateful for you."

“I’m grateful for me too” I said with a suppressed laugh

“You cheeky you” Mahlon said with so much pure joy that it was evident to anyone who saw him that he was one thing, he was--- perfect.




Chapter 10

      It’s time for this part of the story, this is the part that gets me every-time.I really don’t think I can do it, I’ll let Ruth write this part


I’m Ruth and this was the worst time of our lives, Orpie has basically said the bulk of it, our downs and ups but this was by far our greatest down. I still remember it, it still hurts, but I can still stand up and rise because of where Yahweh has brought me now.


It started like a whisper, a nagging worry at the back of my mind. Mahlon and Chilion began coughing, their faces pale and drawn. It was a sickness that crept in slowly, then took them quickly. We prayed, we fasted, we pleaded with Yahweh. But deep down, we knew. We knew what was coming, and it was terrifying.

One night, as Chilion lay in bed, his breathing labored and shallow, he reached out and took my hand. His grip was weak, but the love in his eyes was as strong as ever.

"Ruth," he whispered, his voice hoarse from the sickness. "Be strong, my love. Yahweh is with us, even now."

“is he really” I said amongst tears “because he feels distant, far”

“No matter how far he may feel” His coughing became louder, more consistent “He still loves us”

Tears welled up in my eyes as I nodded, trying to be the pillar of strength he needed me to be. "I know," I whispered back, though my heart was breaking. "I’m trying, but it’s so hard."

He gave me a sad, tired smile. "I know it is. But Yahweh loves us. He has a plan for us, even if we can’t see it right now."

I couldn’t hold back the tears anymore. They flowed freely as I clung to his hand. "I don’t want you to go," I sobbed, my voice shaking. "I need you, Chilion. I need you here with me."

He squeezed my hand gently, though I could feel his strength fading. "I’ll always be with you, Ruth. Even if you can’t see me, I’ll be with you. Yahweh’s love will guide you, I promise."

We cried together, our tears mixing with the hopelessness and fear that hung in the air. And then, in the quiet stillness of the night, I felt his hand go limp in mine. His breathing slowed, then stopped. Chilion was gone.

The memory blurs after that. Everything felt like a nightmare. My heart was shattered, and the world felt like it was crumbling around me. I think I screamed—I’m not sure. The next thing I remember clearly was hearing a piercing wail from the other room. It was Orpah.

Mahlon had just died too.


My best friend had just died. My husband of 10 years gone. Why? Why now, 
when I was just starting to believe in God—in his god? I hate Him. I hate Him so much.

This anger, this seething rage, it’s consuming me. How could He do this? How could Yahweh take Mahlon and Chilion from us? What kind of god does that? I thought—I thought maybe there was something to this faith, something real, something good. But now... now it feels like a cruel joke.

I’m trying to make sense of it, but I can’t. All I feel is the emptiness where they used to be, and the pain is unbearable. Ruth... oh, Ruth, I told her, I told her that this god can’t be all that. This god killing the innocent for his own amusement, is that a good god. No, he can’t be, too many, too many of my loved ones has gone, I can’t bear it anymore.

I scream. I scream until my throat burns, until the anger and sorrow mix together into something raw and uncontainable. My heart feels like it’s shattering into a million pieces, each one sharper than the last.

Why did you leave us? The question echoes in my mind, over and over again. I was just about to believe... but now all I can believe in is the pain.





Chapter 11
Naomi wants to leave. Who could blame her? She’s lost everything—her sons, her hope. Maybe leaving this place will give her some peace, a chance to escape the haunting memories that cling to these walls. And honestly, after everything her god has put us through, she deserves that peace.

But Ruth... Ruth wants to follow her. It’s no surprise; Ruth’s loyalty runs deep, deeper than mine, I sometimes think. But what about me? What do I have left here? Mahlon is gone, Chilion is gone, and the life I thought I was building has crumbled into dust. There’s nothing holding me here anymore.

I can’t stay. I won’t.

I take a deep breath, gathering the strength to voice the decision that’s been forming in my heart. I find Naomi, her face etched with sorrow, yet there’s a resolve in her eyes that wasn’t there before. She’s made up her mind. She’s leaving.


“Naomi,” I begin, my voice steady but soft, “Ruth and I want to follow you.”


Naomi looks at me with a tenderness that pierces through the grief in her eyes.

 “My child,” 

she says, her voice heavy with sorrow, “I have always loved you, but it seems like my presence has only brought pain to you and Ruth. Why would you come with me? I have nothing to offer you.”

At that moment, Ruth came in, her eyes immediately understanding the gravity of our conversation. Without a word, she knelt beside me, her hand gripping mine as tears begin to well up in our eyes.

“Don’t urge us to leave you,” Ruth pleads, her voice breaking. “Don’t turn us back from following you. Where you go, we will go. Where you stay, we will stay. Your people will be our people, and your God, our God. Where you die, we will die, and there we will be buried. May the Lord deal with us, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates us from you.”

Naomi’s lips tremble as she listens to Ruth’s words, the depth of our commitment sinking in. She wipes away her tears, trying to be strong for us. “You don’t understand,” she says, her voice barely a whisper. “I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me, even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you because the Lord’s hand has turned against me.”

Ruth’s grip on my hand tightens, but inside, something shifts. The words “your God will be our God” echo in my mind, and suddenly, the full weight of what that means crashes down on me. If I go with them, I’ll be going back to Bethlehem, to Yahweh, the god who took everything from me. The god I hate. How could I worship Him, after all that’s happened? How could I live in a place where He’s revered, where I’m expected to bow down and pray to Him?

A shiver runs through me as I think about it. The thought of bowing to Yahweh, of pretending to accept His will after He’s taken Mahlon  from me... it’s too much. I can’t do it.


“I... I don’t know if I can,” I whisper, barely able to get the words out.

Naomi’s eyes soften, and she seems to understand what I’m struggling with. “It’s okay, Orpah,” she says gently. “You don’t have to come with us. You can stay here, where it’s familiar, where you don’t have to face what you’re not ready to face.”

Ruth looks at me, her eyes pleading, but I can’t do it. I can’t follow them. The pain of staying is less than the agony of going.

“I’m sorry,” I say, my voice breaking. “I can’t go with you. I just... can’t.”

Ruth’s tears flow freely now, and she hugs me tightly, whispering that she understands, that she loves me no matter what. Naomi gives me a sad, knowing smile, as if she expected this all along.

“Go back to your people, Orpah,” Naomi says softly. “And may the Lord grant you rest in the home of another husband.”

“I love you Naomi, but please don’t talk about the Lord here” I said hastily and with clear indication of my anger and frustration coming forth.

“I understand and I’m sorry” 

“I will miss you all”

“Likewise”

I thought I would never see them again.











Chapter 12

“Am I stupid? Maybe I am, because only a fool would leave a perfect life—perfect mother, perfect sister—just because of some conflict between her and her God. But is He really her God? Has she finally accepted Him? And even if she has, is it not too late?”

You might think things got better after they left. They didn’t. My visions became more frequent. I saw them—my husband, my daughter. They were still alive. If they weren’t, why did I keep seeing them? It made no sense.

I had many servants, but I was still alone. The business the men had left behind was thriving, everything seemed fine on the outside, but inside, my life was falling apart.

One day, as I walked through the courtyard, the images came again, clearer than ever—Naomi, sitting at her favorite spot by the threshold, and Ruth, talking softly with her husband. A faint smile crept onto my lips, but as I moved closer to them, they vanished, and the smile disappeared just as quickly.
Tears began to fall, and then I heard him. I heard him—he was calling me, telling me to take his hand, to follow him wherever he was going.

“Where are you going?” I asked, my voice trembling.

Silence was his only answer. I tried not to dwell on it, but as soon as my hand touched his arm, he disappeared again.

“Mistress, are you okay? Do you need something?” one of the servants asked, noticing my tears. I quickly wiped them away with my sleeve and forced a smile.

“Nothing’s wrong,” I said, my voice barely holding steady. I rushed to my room, desperate to escape the visions.

As soon as I reached my room, it started. First, a headache. Then the voices. I heard a cry—her cry. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my husband, playing with our daughter. She looked older than the last time I saw her. The last time... she wasn’t speaking. Her small hands had been clenched tight, her body cold, almost as if she were dead. But she couldn’t be dead—if she were, why would I be seeing her now, here with my husband?

They looked happy, and I was desperate to feel that happiness with them. I moved closer, but the closer I got, the farther away they seemed. They were slipping from me, fading, leaving me all over again.

“Don’t leave, don’t leave me!” I shouted, moving like someone possessed. But softly, with sadness in their eyes, they both spoke—oddly comforting yet utterly terrifying.

“Orpie, we miss you.”

“I miss you too, please don’t leave.”
Then they left—simply vanished. Tears now flowed freely, and in that moment, I felt as if I cried oceans.

“Don’t go, please,” I begged, my voice barely a whisper. But they didn’t seem to hear me. Desperation clawed at my chest, and I screamed louder, hoping somehow my voice would reach them.

But it was no use.

And then, I faded too.



Chapter 13
“Mistress, mistress, wake up,” I heard the servant’s voice before I even saw him.

“What… where am I?” I asked, disoriented.

“Your home, of course, my lady,” he replied gently.

But under my breath, making sure no one else could hear, I whispered, “This is not my home.”
In that moment, my mind was made up. I was leaving.

How ironic. I hadn’t left this house when my mother and sister did, when I was surrounded by the comfort of familiar faces. But now, I was leaving—alone, with only a camel carrying all my belongings as my only companion.
I left the entire house and the business to the servant from before. I trusted him; he would make a good owner. Perhaps he would do better with it than I ever could.

I didn’t know where I was going—I just knew I was going somewhere. It reminded me of the story Naomi once told me about Abraham. Only this time, I wasn’t doing it out of trust. I was doing it because I wanted to.
About two hours into the journey, I met with a group of prophets prophesying and I heard one of them say:

"Woman, you wander, through pain and trials.
A child you shall bear, comfort you with smiles.
His bloodline shall know the one sealed with a kiss,
His friend, savior, and king amidst.
Through storms he shall walk, he sinks yet he rises;
He shall be the rock, through life’s many crises."

“What was he saying, was he saying that my child will know a king, or my descendant. Was God really compensating me, or was this just my imagination. I mean I don’t even have a husband and I don’t plan on replacing Mahlon any time soon. Also Yahweh has not really been on my side before, why start now. Yeah, this was a joke.






Chapter 14


Heading north to the place I knew not was probably not a wise idea.I soon ran out of food. Then water. 
My camel started complaining, its grumbles growing louder with each passing hour, as though it shared my frustration. Everything was going wrong.

It was the second day of my journey, and all I could think of was, ‘This is Yahweh's fault.’

The heat was unbearable, searing my skin as I pressed forward through the arid landscape. Every step felt like a punishment, like the earth beneath me conspired to slow my progress. The once distant hills loomed nearer, but no closer to offering the shade or relief I desperately sought.

I had been so sure of myself, so certain that leaving Moab would be the answer.
I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t afford to lose any more water. Instead, I gripped the camel’s reins tighter, urging it forward. It groaned and slowed, its legs shaking with fatigue.

"Don't give up on me," I whispered to the beast. But was I really talking to it, or to myself?
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the barren landscape, I finally found a cave—a shelter, at least for the night.
 Exhausted, I eased off the camel and slumped against the cool rock, grateful for the reprieve from the day's merciless heat.
 I had made up my mind: I would settle in Reuben. It was one step closer to my family, to familiarity.

But as I stared into the deepening dusk, one question loomed larger than the others: Was I ready to accept her God? Their God? 
The thought gnawed at me, just as the journey had worn down my body. I still didn’t know. Would I ever?
Tears began to fall again, like an old habit I couldn’t break, uncontrollable and relentless.
 My body trembled with the weight of grief I couldn’t shake, and before I knew it, sleep took me. But in the silence, the visions returned.
I saw him again. This time, his face wasn’t the loving one I remembered. His eyes burned with fury, his voice sharp and accusing.

"This is your fault," he spat, his words like venom. "You let me die!"

I stepped back, my heart pounding. "No... I didn’t mean to—" I stammered, but his voice drowned out my plea.

"You left me. You didn’t fight for me," he growled, stepping closer, his face twisted with anger. "You gave up. You always give up."

Tears streamed down my face as I shook my head, desperate to escape his gaze. "I didn’t know… I didn’t know how to save you."

"You never tried," he said coldly, his form starting to fade, "Leaving me alone with the weight of his words."

“But I did," I whispered, the words barely audible, soft and broken. My voice cracked as if my own belief faltered.

"You are not important," he sneered, his form darkening, the venom in his voice cutting deep. "Now see—you're all alone."

I trembled, the air around me growing heavier. Something in me screamed that this couldn’t be him, not truly. But another part—buried deep within—whispered otherwise: It is him. And he’s right.

"God," I whispered, my voice barely holding together. "If you are real, if you truly love me, save me. Save me now."

Silence followed. Cold, empty silence.

Then, out of the darkness, laughter—cruel and mocking.

"Do you really think that God loves you?" The voice dripped with malice, each word like a sharpened blade cutting through the air. "If He did, He wouldn’t have allowed her to die. 
He wouldn’t have let me die."

Tears welled up, flowing more freely than ever before. My chest heaved with the weight of unbearable grief.
 "He may not love me," I whispered,

"but He loved you. I know that."

A cruel laugh echoed around me. "Love?" The voice was darker now, more sinister, as though the air itself had thickened with evil. "No, you were right. God is wicked."
 The words twisted in the air, vile and venomous, nothing like my husband—nothing like the man I had loved.
"God, please."

The words were fragile, barely audible, but once spoken, they seemed to hang in the air.
 As if in response, he disappeared—vanished into the darkness. A wave of relief washed over me, a peace I didn’t recognize. It felt soothing, almost too good to be true.

But then the doubts crept in.

What if he was already leaving? The thought slithered into my mind, unwelcome but persistent. 
Maybe it had nothing to do with God. Maybe the voice, the torment—it was all in my head. Or maybe he’d grown tired of haunting me, ready to leave long before I uttered that desperate prayer.

My heart pounded, uncertainty blooming in my chest. Was that peace truly from Him? Or was it something else?

A flicker of something darker stirred at the edges of my thoughts. He didn’t answer you. He doesn’t care. The same voice as before—low, insidious—crept back in, whispering, testing the fragile calm.

I tried to shake it off, clinging to the feeling of peace that still lingered in the silence. But the voice persisted. You really think that pathetic plea changed anything?

I clenched my fists, squeezing my eyes shut, fighting the creeping doubt that threatened to undo everything. Naomi’s words echoed faintly in my mind: You may not hear Him, but you’ll feel Him.

Was this it? Was this supposed to be Him? Or was I just imagining everything, hoping for something that wasn’t real?

The voice inside grew louder. Face it—He didn’t do anything. It wasn’t Him.

But this time, I chose to ignore it. I had to. I needed to. With every ounce of strength, I forced myself to focus on the quiet, the peace still present, though faint. Slowly, the sinister whispers faded, growing quieter, until they were nothing but a distant hum.

And then… silence. Real silence.

Maybe it was Him. Maybe it wasn’t. I still didn’t know for sure. But for the first time in a long time, I wasn’t alone.


Chapter 15
When I woke up, the first thing I noticed was the quiet—it was soft, like a blanket over my mind. It wasn’t the sad emptiness or the heavy silence that came after the visions. This was something else. It felt peaceful.

I woke up my camel, my only companion on this journey, and we set off again. We were getting closer to Reuben and closer to my family. To be honest, I couldn’t wait.




By late afternoon, I had reached Aroer in Reuben. The sun was soft, casting a warm glow over everything. 
I could hear the Levites singing in the distance, their voices gentle as they prepared for the evening sacrifice. The air smelled of fresh bread and spices from the marketplace.

Women laughed and chatted while moving between the stalls, their baskets full. 
Children ran and played, their laughter ringing through the streets. For the first time in a long while, I smiled. Everything around me felt alive—full of joy and light. The weight I had carried for so long seemed to lift. I felt lighter, almost free.

I walked with my camel beside me, and for once, the burden of the past didn’t press down on my heart. I breathed in deeply, letting the warmth of the town surround me. It was good. I was okay.

But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw them—a family. A husband, a wife, and their little girl. They were holding hands, laughing together as they walked. The mother’s smile was so soft, so full of love. The father leaned down as the little girl tugged at his arm, and the joy in their eyes was something I had once known.

My smile disappeared.

A wave of sorrow crashed over me so suddenly, I could barely catch my breath. Tears filled my eyes, blurring the scene before me as I stood frozen, watching them. It felt as if every loss I had endured, every dream I would never reclaim, was being paraded in front of me.

My heart throbbed with a deep, unbearable ache, and though I tried to hold the tears back, they spilled down my cheeks, unstoppable. My knees grew weak under the weight of the grief, and I swayed, unsteady, until a firm but gentle hand caught my arm, steadying me.

Through the mist of my tears, I blinked, and slowly, a face emerged—a kind, handsome face. My heart gave an unexpected flutter, and I felt warmth rush to my cheeks before I even understood why.

"Hi," he said, his voice gentle and soothing. "I’m Jorai. I hope you don’t mind me stepping in."

"I… I… n-no, not at all," I stammered, struggling to form a coherent response as the heat rose to my face.

What’s happening to me? I thought, my heart racing. I just arrived here.

My thoughts scrambled, but I couldn’t tear myself away from the warmth in his eyes or the calm that surrounded him like a shield.
 I had barely stepped into this unfamiliar place, and already, something inside me was shifting."You seem lost," Jorai said softly, his voice a comforting balm. "Maybe I should take you to my house?"

His words startled me. His house? I instinctively took a small step back. 
"What do you mean? I don’t even know you." The warmth I had felt moments ago quickly turned into suspicion, a knot forming in my chest.

Jorai held up his hands, his expression gentle. "I understand how you feel, but—"

"But what?" I snapped, my voice sharp with distrust. "You think you're good? Like your god is good? That good god took everything from me."Tears filled my eyes, the pain rushing back like a flood I couldn’t control. My voice cracked, heavy with the weight of my grief.

"My husband, my best friend, my daughter—everything!" I shouted, the words pouring out before I could stop them. I felt like I was falling apart, emotions crashing over me, making me feel like I was losing my grip.
"Please, calm down," Jorai whispered softly, his voice urgent yet kind. "Everyone is watching."

As he said that, reality hit me. He was right. Everyone was looking at me.

I glanced around and saw people whispering to one another, their faces filled with mixed emotions. 
Some were clearly disgusted, shielding their children from the scene as if I were some spectacle to be avoided. 
Others looked on with sympathy, their eyes full of understanding and quiet compassion. 
A few even gave me small nods of encouragement, as if willing me to hold on and pull myself together.
The weight of their stares felt unbearable, pressing down on me like a physical force.
 But Jorai’s hand remained steady on my arm, grounding me when I felt like I was spiraling out of control. His voice, now just a whisper, was firm but gentle.

“Let’s go,” he said.

This time, I wasn’t hesitant. I nodded, willing myself to follow him. Anything to escape the crowd, the shame, the mix of pity and judgment that felt like it was swallowing me whole. But just as I took a step, my breath caught in my throat.

I saw him.

Mahlon.

His face flickered before me, so real that my heart stuttered painfully in my chest. My husband. The man I had loved, the man I had lost. His eyes were the same—kind, warm, filled with the love I had known so well. But now they were distant, unreachable, like a shadow from another life.

My legs trembled beneath me. How could he be here? Was this real? Or was it just my grief playing tricks on me again? I froze, torn between the past and the present, my mind caught in a tug-of-war. Part of me wanted to run to him, to throw myself into his arms and pretend none of this had ever happened. To cling to the love we shared, to the life that had been stolen from us.

But the other part of me knew... it wasn’t real. He wasn’t here. He was gone, and no amount of wishing would bring him back.

My heart ached with the weight of it all. I wanted to scream, to cry out, but I couldn’t move. The grief wrapped around me like a suffocating cloak, tightening with each passing second.

Jorai’s hand squeezed mine gently, pulling me back from the edge. “Are you alright?” he asked, his voice filled with concern.

I blinked, the image of Mahlon fading into the background, replaced by the world around me—the stares, the whispers, the strangers who could never understand.

“No,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “But I will be.”

And with that, I took another step forward.

Chapter 16
His house was not nearly half bad. In fact, it was actually good, not to lie.

As I stepped inside, I couldn’t help but glance around, taking in the space. 
The walls were made of solid stone, rough-hewn but strong, giving the house a sense of permanence. 
It felt solid, secure, as though it could withstand anything. Back in Moab, our home had been different—warmer. 
The walls there didn’t just keep us safe; they welcomed the sun, absorbing its light and wrapping our home in a gentle glow that filled every room with warmth. But here, the stone felt cold, almost too strong, too solid.

I ran my hand along one of the wooden beams supporting the ceiling. The dark wood was sturdy, just like everything else here, built with practicality in mind. It was a home meant to last, to endure.
 In Moab, the beams in our house had been carved with intricate patterns, a small touch of art in the everyday. Here, the furniture was simpler—strong, yes, but unadorned. It served its purpose, but it didn’t tell a story.

The floors were bare, cold stone beneath my feet. In Moab, we had bright rugs, soft underfoot, patterns woven into them that made every step feel like home.
 Here, everything seemed muted, blending into the earth itself. The walls were clean, but too bare for my taste. Back home, we had colorful tapestries that added warmth to every corner. Here, the space was quieter, as if the house didn’t know how to speak.

Jorai moved about the room, lighting a small fire in the hearth. The warmth spread slowly, but it wasn’t enough to fill the emptiness I felt inside. In Moab, the hearth had been a centerpiece—large and roaring, a place where we all gathered. This hearth was humble, enough for Jorai, but to me, it seemed small.

Outside, through a small doorway, I could see a tiny courtyard. It was simple, with an olive tree and a few herbs growing along the edges. It was peaceful, a quiet retreat. But in Moab, our courtyard had been alive—bright flowers, fruit trees, a small fountain bubbling in the center. It felt like a place that breathed life. This courtyard, though pleasant, felt too still.

I tried to shake the feeling of comparison, but it clung to me. Everything here was different—stronger in some ways, but lacking the color, the warmth, the life that had filled my home  back in Moab.

Jorai noticed my silence and came over, offering me a bowl of water. His eyes were kind, and I knew he was trying to make me feel at ease. “What do you think of the house?” he asked.

I smiled softly. “It’s beautiful,” I said, meaning it in a way.

He smiled back, clearly pleased. “I’m glad.”

I nodded, but inside, I felt torn. This house was well-made, solid, and kind in its own way. But it wasn’t filled with the warmth I had once known. It wasn’t filled with them—the people I had loved and lost.

And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow near the doorway. My breath hitched.
Mahlon.

For a moment, it was as though he stood there, his face clear and familiar. My husband. His eyes were the same—kind, loving. The life we had shared flashed before me, and my heart ached as if no time had passed at all.

I blinked, and the image was gone. Just an empty doorway remained, the cold stone walls around me pressing in.

Jorai must have noticed something change in my face. He touched my arm gently. “Are you alright?” he asked, his voice filled with quiet concern.
I forced a smile, but the heaviness in my chest remained. “Yes,” I whispered. “It’s just… different.”

“It’s hard getting used to new places,” he said.

“Who says I’m staying here long enough to get used to it?” I replied with a small chuckle, which made him chuckle too. But then his expression shifted, his gaze growing serious.

“So, about the market… what happened? What happened to your husband and daughter?”My heart tightened. I looked away, the weight of those words too much to bear. 

“Forget it,” I said softly, but he took it as a cue to probe closer, to uncover more of the past I wasn’t ready to share.

“Was he a good guy?” he asked gently.

“Who?” I muttered, even though I already knew.
“Your husband.”

I paused, the words catching in my throat. “The best,” I whispered, and with that, the tears and memories came rushing back—flooding through me in an overwhelming tide. There was no stopping them now.

“There, there,” Jorai said gently, reaching out to wipe away my tears. “Tell me about him. It might make you feel better.”

I hesitated but then nodded, my voice trembling as I began. “Okay, well, for one, he was a funny man. I didn’t always understand his jokes, but I appreciated them, even now.”

I smiled through my tears, feeling the warmth of the memories. “Oh, he once told me the... oh, what was it now?” I paused, struggling to recall. “I can’t remember the name, but it was a good one.”

Jorai chuckled softly, encouraging me. “Come on, you’ve got to remember at least one of his jokes.”

I searched my memory, and when it finally came to me, I grinned. “Oh! It was something about a camel walking into a market… he said the punchline so confidently, but I just stared at him, completely confused. He laughed harder at my reaction than the joke itself.”

Jorai laughed heartily, and I found myself laughing too—a sound I hadn’t heard from my own lips in what felt like ages. His laughter was infectious, and for a moment, the heaviness in my chest lifted.

I continued, my voice softening as I spoke more about Mahlon. “He always made sure I never felt alone, even on the hardest days. I remember once, after a long day in the fields, he came home covered in dirt, grinning from ear to ear, holding flowers he had picked just for me. They were half-wilted, but he didn’t care. He just wanted to make me smile.”

Jorai listened intently, his gaze warm and open, drawing me in. “Sounds like a man who truly cared.”
“He did,” I said, nodding slowly. “He had this way of making even the smallest moments feel like they mattered. We would sit by the fire at night, talking for hours about nothing and everything. Sometimes we wouldn’t even talk—we’d just sit in silence, but it never felt awkward. It was... comforting.”

Jorai listened closely, then gently asked, “What about your daughter?”

My chest tightened instantly, and the warmth from moments ago faded. “Now you’re getting ahead of yourself,” I snapped, feeling the anger rise inside me.

Jorai’s expression shifted, softening. “I can see that’s a sensitive topic.”
“Yes, it is,” I said sharply, my voice tinged with bitterness. “So please, don’t talk about it.” I stood abruptly, the need to leave overwhelming me. But as I looked around, realizing I had no idea where to go, I hesitated and sank back down, frustrated and lost.

We sat there in silence, the tension thick between us, as I struggled with my emotions. I could feel the weight of my anger and grief settling between us, almost tangible in the air.

After what felt like an eternity, Jorai finally broke the silence. “My wife died four years ago,” he said softly.

My anger melted away almost instantly, replaced by a sudden wave of pity and compassion. I blinked, my throat tightening as I realized I had been so wrapped up in my own pain, I hadn’t considered his. “What happened?” I asked, feeling guilty for probing after I had just shut him down for doing the same thing.

“Sickness,” he replied, his voice low but steady. “It was her time. Yahweh, the giver of life and the taker thereof, decided it was time for her to go.”

I felt a pang in my chest, a sympathy that I hadn’t expected. But then his words struck a nerve, and my sympathy quickly turned to bitterness again. “I sympathize with you,” I said carefully, “but I have to draw the line there. The god that took your wife is the god you worship?”

Jorai looked at me calmly, his expression unwavering. “From your display in the market, I could tell that your problems came from a hatred for Yahweh. Probably because of what has happened to you.”

“What has happened to me,” I said through gritted teeth, “does not determine how I feel about your god. He’s just a horrible, blood-sucking, despicable god.”

“Is he?” Jorai asked quietly, his voice free of anger, just a simple question hanging in the air.

His calmness only fueled my frustration. “Yes,” I said bitterly. “He lets people die, takes away everything they love, and then expects them to keep worshipping him? How is that not horrible?”

Jorai’s gaze softened, and he leaned forward slightly. “I understand your anger, Orpah. Truly, I do. I felt the same when I lost my wife. But I’ve learned that Yahweh doesn’t take for cruelty’s sake. He takes when it’s time, and it’s not easy to accept. But it doesn’t mean he is despicable.”

I shook my head, feeling the familiar bitterness rise up in my chest. “Well, maybe you’ve accepted that. But I can’t. I won’t.”
We sat there in silence again, the air heavy with words left unspoken, my heart still wrestling with everything that had been taken from me.
 Jorai’s presence remained steady, unshaken by my outburst, and that only deepened my confusion. How could he be so calm, so at peace, when the god he worshipped had taken so much from him? How did he not feel the anger that consumed me?

After a long pause, Jorai stood and spoke gently. “Come, let me take you to your room. We’ll talk more about this tomorrow.”

I nodded slowly, my emotions still swirling, though the intensity had begun to ebb. “Okay,” I said softly, standing to follow him. “By the way… I’m sorry for shouting. There’s a lot I needed to unpack.”

He gave me a small, understanding smile. “I know,” he said, his tone warm and reassuring. “It’s alright.”
As we walked through the quiet house, I felt a strange sense of relief, as though admitting my pain had released something inside me. He led me to a small room at the end of a narrow hallway.

The space was simple but comforting. The walls, made of the same sturdy stone as the rest of the house, were softened by a large woven tapestry that hung above the bed, depicting a peaceful landscape in muted earth tones. 
The bed itself was low, with thick wool blankets neatly folded at the foot, their deep blues and browns a contrast to the pale linens. There was a small wooden chest in the corner, its surface worn and smooth, and a single window across from it, allowing a soft, amber light from the setting sun to filter in.

A clay lamp rested on a small table beside the bed, casting a warm, flickering glow over the room. The air smelled faintly of herbs—lavender or sage, perhaps—giving the space a calming, almost soothing feel.
It wasn’t elaborate, but it felt safe. A quiet, personal space where I could retreat from the weight of everything outside.

“Thanks… for everything,” I murmured, my voice soft and weary.

“It’s okay,” Jorai replied, his voice gentle but steady. He offered me a small nod, then quietly left the room, closing the door behind him.

The silence settled in almost immediately, and with it came the familiar ache of loneliness. The room felt smaller, the walls closing in around me as the absence of his presence grew more noticeable. 
The warmth I had felt moments ago, when I was speaking with him, seemed to slip away, leaving me alone with my thoughts once more.

I lay down on the bed, pulling the wool blankets up around me, trying to cling to the fleeting sense of peace I had found. But as the quiet deepened, so did the emptiness. The pain, the loss, all the things I had tried to keep buried began to rise to the surface again.

The loneliness was suffocating, yet exhaustion pulled at me. My body was tired—too tired to keep fighting against the flood of memories and emotions that I had been holding back. I closed my eyes, hoping sleep would come quickly and that the night would offer me some measure of relief.

But little did I know, sleep would not bring the peace I so desperately craved. The dreams came fast, pulling me under before I had the chance to resist. 
At first, they were just fragments—flashes of familiar faces, places from a time that felt like another life. But soon, the fragments took shape, and the past came to life before me.

I saw him—Mahlon.


Chapter 17
I woke up with a start, my heart racing, sweat trickling down my cheeks. 
The remnants of the dream clung to me, wrapping me in a cold, suffocating fog. 
I sat up in bed, gasping for breath, my chest tight with the weight of the nightmare. My pulse was erratic, and the room felt too small, too confining.

I needed air.

Throwing the blanket off, I slipped quietly out of the room and made my way outside. The cool morning breeze hit my skin as I stepped into the quiet of the courtyard. The early light of dawn barely touched the horizon, casting a soft glow across the stone walls. The air felt fresh, and I took a deep breath, hoping to clear my mind.

Jorai was sitting there, already awake, his gaze steady as he stared at the sky, lost in thought. He noticed me almost instantly and turned, offering a small smile. “Oh, you’re awake,” he said, his voice gentle in the stillness of the morning.

“Yeah,” I mumbled, still trying to shake off the lingering heaviness of the dream.

He patted the chair beside him, gesturing for me to sit. “Come, join me.”
I hesitated for a moment but eventually walked over and sat down, the cool stone of the chair grounding me. Jorai didn’t ask what had woken me, and I was grateful for that.

After a quiet moment, he broke the silence. “So, about yesterday…”
I sighed, a faint smile tugging at my lips. “You don’t give up, do you?”

“I never got your name,” he said, still gazing up at the morning sun, its warm light casting a soft glow over his face.

“Orpah,” I replied, a hint of amusement in my voice. “You took in a stranger, and you didn’t even know her name?”

He chuckled, glancing over at me. “Well, sometimes you don’t need a name to know someone.”
I raised an eyebrow, feeling a bit curious. “And what does that mean?”

“It means,” he said, his gaze shifting from the sunrise to meet mine, “I knew you and I had something in common. And when you talked about your husband, I knew what it was.”
His eyes held mine, steady and sincere, and for a moment, I forgot to breathe. The butterflies I thought had died long ago stirred, fluttering back to life.

“Sorry again about your wife,” I said softly, unsure if my words could really convey the sympathy I felt.

“It’s okay, really,” he replied, his voice warm and reassuring.”I just want you to understand that I know what you are going through, I understand how you feel”
“But how did you do it?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. “How do you still love Yahweh after everything?”

He looked at me, a hint of something unreadable in his eyes. “Who says I do?”

I blinked, surprised. He laughed softly at my confusion, a warm, genuine sound that broke the tension. “I still worship Yahweh.”

“So you love him despite what he’s done?” I asked, a hint of anger creeping into my voice.

“That’s your problem, Orpah,” he said, his voice calm but firm. “You think that whatever happens, it’s automatically God’s fault.”

“Is it not?” I shot back, my frustration bubbling to the surface. “Was he not the one who took everything from me?”

Jorai held my gaze, his expression unshaken. “Did he really? Look back, Orpah. Think of everything that’s happened. Weren’t there times he comforted you? Weren’t there moments when you knew things could have been so much worse, but you felt… cared for, somehow? Like he was waiting, patient and present, even in the hardest times?”

His words stirred something within me, an uncomfortable awareness of memories I had tried to bury—moments of quiet peace after the storm, times when I’d felt an inexplicable sense of protection even in my pain. But the anger in me resisted, refusing to yield so easily.

“Maybe,” I muttered, looking away. “But it doesn’t change what I lost.”
“No,” Jorai agreed softly, “it doesn’t. But it might change the way you see what remains.”

“Like what?” I asked, a mix of frustration and curiosity flickering within me.

He shrugged, a gentle smile crossing his face. “I don’t know, Orpah. You know yourself. I think you can figure it out.”
With that, he stood up,dusting off his hands, and a subtle scent of cedar followed him. I noticed his hands then—strong, calloused, with tiny nicks and cuts that spoke of hours spent crafting. I glanced around and took in the small details I hadn’t noticed before: the neatly stacked planks by the wall, the tools hanging with care in the corner, each one placed just so.
“I’ve got some orders to work on,” he said, gesturing toward a half-finished table beside his workbench. “But I’ll be back soon.”

He left me to my thoughts, his words lingering in the silence around me. Was he right? The question drifted through my mind, unbidden, and I tried to push it away.
 “What are you talking about? How could he be right? Yahweh doesn’t love you. Not now. Not after you’ve turned your back on him.” it’s true, I have rejected him openly, defiantly—he couldn’t love me now.

Yet everyone else, it seemed, believed otherwise. Jorai spoke of Yahweh with a steady conviction, as though his faith were unshakable, despite the pain he’d known. How could he still trust this god, the same one I felt had abandoned me? They all seemed so certain, so willing to believe, while I felt only doubt and anger.

But isn’t he the god of everything?  Yeah in Moab, we had gods for different things—a god for rain, another for the harvest, one for fertility, for life and death. A god could be turned to, honored for a specific blessing or plea. But to say that one god did everything, ruled over all things… It was strange. And to see that same god ignore suffering, to know he had the power to stop it yet chose not to—it felt like he was misbehaving, turning away from his own people.
“Exactly, don’t let anyone deceive you, Yahweh does not love you and he never will” But everyone else—everyone—seems to find happiness in their worship. Naomi and Ruth are sure Yahweh will welcome them back. Jorai is content with his work, and he even helped a stranger like me. My husband, his brother, and their father all loved Yahweh deeply, even to the end.

Only me, left standing apart, just because I couldn’t let go.


Chapter 18

When I met her, I thought she was God’s way of apologizing for taking my Eliana. She looked exactly like her—same dark hair, same gentle smile that could light up the darkest room. She questioned like her, stubborn like her, even the way she tilted her head when she was deep in thought.

It wasn’t just the resemblance in looks; it was the way Orpah carried herself, the quiet strength in her eyes. I saw Eliana in her, and for a long time, I convinced myself that this was a sign, a gift from Yahweh to heal the void she had left behind.

The other part of me saw it as my task. I hadn’t saved Eliana—I wasn’t there for her when she needed me most. This was my chance for redemption, my do-over. Maybe, just maybe, I could help Orpah heal the way I failed to help my own wife.

I glanced at my workbench, at the unfinished table in front of me. Eliana had loved this craft of mine. She used to sit in that same corner, right there where the morning light spills onto the floor, watching me carve wood. She would hum softly, her voice blending with the sound of the chisel against grain.

“You’ll work yourself to death one day, Jorai,” she’d say with that teasing smile, the one that made me forget the world for a moment.
I met Eliana when we were both young still under our father’s houses. We started as friends as all love stories should. 
We grew up, together and in love. We didn’t have kids, but I didn’t need them, all I needed was her and I thought she knew that, I hope she knew that. The quiet hum of the shop fades, and for a moment, the weight of the unfinished table, the cold wood beneath my fingers, disappears. I hear her voice again, the way it always used to fill the room.

The workshop smells of fresh wood and the earthiness of sawdust, but it’s warmer now—her presence wrapping around me like the sunlight filtering through the window.

She’s sitting on the old wooden bench by the corner, humming softly. I look up from the workbench to find her smiling at me, that familiar sparkle in her eyes.
"All I need is you," I say softly, almost a whisper, she reaches for my hand. "I know, Jorai.”

I watch her fingers brush against mine, a familiar, grounding touch. Her smile is gentle, but there’s something in her eyes, a softness mixed with a quiet concern.

"You always say that," she murmurs, her voice low and almost secretive. "But I need you to remember that sometimes, Jorai, we’re more than just each other. We have to find balance. You... You can’t lose yourself in your work, not like this."

I look at her, puzzled, as if her words are a riddle I can’t quite solve. But she doesn’t explain further. Instead, she leans her head on my shoulder, the scent of her hair mingling with the wood and the sawdust, and I feel like the world could stop spinning, and I wouldn’t care.

"But I don’t want anything else," I protest, trying to push back the unease that she always seemed to notice, the way I buried myself in the craft. "I have you, and I have this. This is all I need."

She sighs, the kind of sigh that holds a world of things unspoken. "And what if, one day, you look up and I’m not here anymore, Jorai? What will you have left?"

Her words pierce through me, sharp and unexpected. I freeze, suddenly aware of the weight they carry. I try to laugh, to brush it off, but the sound of her voice lingers in the air, making the room feel smaller, more fragile.

“I’ll have you,” I say again, more firmly this time. “You’re not going anywhere.”

But even as I say the words, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s already trying to prepare me for something I can’t quite understand. That maybe, deep down, she knows something I don't.

But even as I say the words, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s trying to prepare me for something I can’t quite grasp. That, deep down, she knows something I don’t.

"What's wrong? You sound sad," I say, the concern creeping into my voice.

She doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, her fingers trace the edge of the workbench, her gaze drifting somewhere beyond me, as if searching for the right words. I feel a shift in the air, a tension that wasn’t there a moment ago. Her silence stretches, and I find myself holding my breath, waiting for her to speak.

When she finally looks up at me, her smile is soft, but there's a heaviness behind it that I can't ignore. "I'm just... thinking," she says, but there's something fragile in her voice, something that tells me she's carrying more than she's letting on.

I reach for her hand, brushing my thumb over her knuckles. "What are you thinking about?"

She takes a deep breath, her eyes flickering with something I can't quite name. "About us. About you, Jorai. Sometimes I wonder if you’re really here with me, or if you’re lost in your work again. I need you here, fully. Not just... in the moments when it's easy."

Her words hit harder than I expect, stirring something in me. The truth I’ve been avoiding surfaces like a tide, and I realize that she’s right. I’ve been so focused on everything else—on the table, on my guilt, on this idea of redemption—that I’ve forgotten to show up for her, in the ways that matter most.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper, squeezing her hand tighter. “I didn’t realize how much I’ve been pulling away.”She smiles, but it’s small, tinged with sadness. "You don't need to apologize. I just need you to remember that I’m here, Jorai. And I always will be—if you let me."

For a long moment, we sit in silence, the weight of her words settling between us. I don’t know what to say at first. There’s so much I want to tell her, but the words feel heavy, like gravel in my mouth, and when I swallow, they stick in my throat.
"Do you... want a child?" I ask sheepishly, the question slipping out before I can stop it.

She looks at me, eyes wide with surprise. "What?" she replies, her voice sharp, almost too quick.

"I... I..." I stumble over the words, unsure of how to explain.
Then, she softens, and for the first time in a while, I see a glimmer of understanding in her gaze. "I understand what you mean," she says quietly, her voice soothing.

And it all went downhill from there. Children are supposed to be a gift from God, but this one was not. The pregnancy was hard—random bleeding, painful cries in the night. She started talking to the walls, saying she was speaking to her dead brother, killed in battle. Then she died. My fault.

I’m sorry if I’m not narrating this well. It’s just such a hard time for me. All I know is that Orpah was supposed to be my redemption. At least, I hope she is.

One thing I know me and Orpah have in common we both have things we wish we can change. I hope we can.
